# CS5300-Project3-RealTime2DObjectRecognition

Summary of Project:
Overall, this project was recognizing object shapes in real time and in photos.  It used techniques of thresholding, morphological filtering for cleaning up the binary image, segmented the image into regions to get the foreground/background, computed features for the major region, and collected data that would be used for later classifying the images. Images by photo/video were classed by using nearest neighbor techniques and K-Nearest Neighbor techniques. The performance of the system was evaluated by generating a Confusion Matrix.
